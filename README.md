# ðŸ“§ Email Spam or Ham Classifier

A machine learning project that classifies emails as **Spam** or **Ham (Not Spam)** using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and supervised learning.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This project builds a binary text classifier to detect spam messages. Using NLP techniques and traditional ML algorithms like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, the system can automatically filter unwanted messages.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Optional UI**: Streamlit for web-based interface

## âœ… Features

- Text preprocessing: cleaning, stopword removal, TF-IDF vectorization
- Trained classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression
- Evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- Web interface for testing messages (optional)

## ðŸ“ˆ Sample Results

| Metric     | Score (Example) |
|------------|-----------------|
| Accuracy   | 98.7%           |
| Precision  | 97.5%           |
| Recall     | 96.2%           |
| F1-score   | 96.8%           |
